# Bowling Score Board

## Rules of Play

Rules of play
A game of bowling consists of ten frames. In each frame, the bowler will have two chances to knock
down a maximum of 10 pins in total. In games with more than one bowler, as is common, every
bowler will take their frame in a predetermined order before the next frame begins. If a bowler is able
to knock down all ten pins with their first ball, he is awarded a strike. If the bowler is able to knock
down all 10 pins with the two balls of a frame, it is known as a spare. In case of strike the total of
score in the next frame is awarded. In case of a spare the award is only the score reached with the
first ball. If the bowler knocks down all 10 pins in the tenth frame, the bowler is allowed to throw 3
balls for that frame. This allows for a potential of 12 strikes in a single game, and a maximum score of
300 points, a perfect game.
